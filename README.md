## Description
This app is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where users can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. It allows guerst users to view posts, but requires sign-up or login in order to create posts or add comments. Once logged in, users can view their dashboard to see and edit their own posts. Users are automatically logged out after 1 minute of inactivity. This app is written in JavaScript, uses Handlebars.js to render dynamic HTML to a page layout and creates, reads, updates and deletes data within a MySQL database. The app is deployed using Node.js on Heroku.

## Details and Learnings
- The application is responsive to different screen widths
- When the user is logged in, a logged-in flag appears below the header displaying the username
- Validation exists on all entry fields including email, password and when creating a post
- Comments cannot be added unless a user is logged in. I handled error messages between a mix of browser form functionality and error messages rendering directly to the page. I wanted to avoid using alerts.
- This application uses the hierarchical structure of MVC - Model, View Controller - in order to separate concerns and functionality
- This structure and the use of handlebars.js for templating and rendering dynamic HTML meant a clean and structured code base with great scalability
- The Dashboard shows your own posts, but there is no further profile information or functionality or the ability for users to connect outside of posts
- Some additions that were out of scope for the user story but I considered were:
  - Rendering a 404 page for invalid URLs
  - Improving routing post login. For example, you are unable to comment if you are not logged in, but upon logging in you are not taken back to the post you were viewing
  - Adding an 'edited' flag if a user modifies a post once it has been posted
  - Keyword search functionality
